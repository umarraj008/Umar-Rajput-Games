## 🧠 About This Collection

This repo is a personal journey through learning and experimenting with web game development. Some of the games are complete, others are rough prototypes—but each one represents a step forward in my understanding of game design, animation, and interactivity on the web.

## 🎨 Features & Techniques Explored

* 🖼️ **Canvas graphics** – low-level pixel manipulation and shape drawing
* 🧍 **Spritesheet animations** – frame-based character and object animation
* 🔊 **Audio integration** – adding sounds and music
* 🌍 **Scenes & levels** – managing game flow and structure
* 🧭 **Scene manager** – switching between menus, gameplay, etc.
* 💥 **Visual effects** – camera shake, fade transitions, animated scene changes

> ⚠️ Some games may not be fully functional, but they still showcase key concepts and technical progress.
